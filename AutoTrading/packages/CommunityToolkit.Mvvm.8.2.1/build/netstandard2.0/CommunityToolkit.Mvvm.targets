        as: "C:\...\.nuget\...\CommunityToolkit.Mvvm\analyzers\roslyn4.0\cs\CommunityToolkit.Mvvm". The [System.String]::Concat trick is used to achieve two things: we can't directly
        invoke a property function (ie. Contains in this case) on a metadata item, so we need an intermediate string to invoke it on. We could also use [System.String]::new, but using
        Concat is more efficient as it'll just skip the allocation entirely if one of the two inputs is an empty string, which is the case here.
